      <p>
        A precedent is a proof: it shows that reading doesn’t have to move forward like a line.
        It can move <span class="em">sideways</span>, loop back, or jump to a different node.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the <span class="em">Garden of Forking Paths</span>, every decision produces more than one future.
        This site borrows that logic: links are not “next pages.” They are forks.

          The layout is calm and minimal so the structure becomes the main interaction.
          The header acts like a map legend — a reminder that you are navigating, not scrolling.

            Returning is not neutral. It doesn’t erase the path you took — it changes how you read the hub.
            The “same” page becomes a different page because your attention is different.
