      <h1>Hierarchy as interaction</h1>
      <p>
        Hierarchy isn’t just “big title, small body.” It can be a behavior.
        What appears first, what is hidden, and what needs effort to reach —
        that becomes the interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        On this site, the hierarchy is simple: the hub is a clear entry, and each page
        offers small choices to continue. The structure is minimal, but the order still
        shapes how the story feels.
      </p>

        What you see first becomes what you think matters.
